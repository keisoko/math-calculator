# math-calculator

Simple math calculator made using structural pattern matching

## Description

The structural pattern matching used in **`calculate_value`** function requires Python 3.10+. **`math.cbrt(x)`** function used to calculate cubic root of x and **`math.exp2(x)`** function that returns the value of 2 raised to the power x requires Python 3.11.

To run the program assign appropriate operation to the **`math_operation`** variable (e.g. "addition") and desirable pair of numbers to **`first_number`** and **`second_number`**. If you want to sum more than two values together, assign the appropriate list of numbers to the **`list_of_numbers_to_sum`** variable.

Repeat the same process to calculate the square and cubic roots of the given value (e.g. "cubic root" to the **`root_operation`** and 729 to the **`number_to_be_rooted`**)
